# bash0setup

config bomb for bash

Things here could use some 'splainin'


## Completions

Completions can be just as complicated as the functions they work for.

As this is my first attempt at any sort of bash completion, this set of notes
will help me look back on anything fishy.

### vic

* excludes non-ascii files from completion.
* there may be a way to add colored-completion output


# want

See `wish`, also.

* package manager install, for portability and release-based maintenance
